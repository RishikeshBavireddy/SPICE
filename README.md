# Ngspice Tutorial: DC Operating Point & DC Sweep Analysis

This guide introduces **DC operating point analysis** and **DC sweep analysis** in [Ngspice](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/).

It is written for beginners: even if you have never used SPICE before, you can follow along by copying the code examples into text files and running them.

## 1. DC Operating Point Analysis

The **DC operating point** (also called the bias point or Q-point) is the set of node voltages and currents in a circuit when only DC sources are applied.
It is used to check biasing conditions in circuits like amplifiers.

### Example: Voltage Divider

Create a file named `divider.cir` with the following content:

```spice
* Voltage Divider Circuit
V1 in 0 DC 10
R1 in out 5k
R2 out 0 10k

.op
.end
```

* `V1 in 0 DC 10` defines a 10 V DC source between node `in` and ground (`0`).
* `R1` and `R2` form a simple resistor divider.
* `.op` tells Ngspice to compute the operating point.
* `.end` marks the end of the file.

### Running the Simulation

Save the file and run:

```bash
ngspice divider.cir
```

If `.op` is present, Ngspice automatically prints the node voltages and branch currents.

Expected result:

* `V(out)` ≈ 3.33 V
* `I(R1)` = `I(R2)` ≈ 0.33 mA

## I–V of a Simple Resistor

A simple way to demonstrate DC sweep is to measure the current through a resistor while sweeping a voltage source. This produces a straight line I–V curve that follows Ohm's law:
$I = \dfrac{V}{R}$

### Circuit file: `resistor_iv.cir`

```spice
* Resistor I-V characteristic using DC sweep
* Sweep a source from 0 to 10 V and measure current through the source

V1 in 0 0       ; voltage source to be swept (node 'in' to ground)
R1 in 0 1k      ; 1 kohm resistor between node 'in' and ground

.dc V1 0 10 0.5 ; sweep V1 from 0 V to 10 V in 0.5 V steps
.print dc v(in) i(V1)
.end
```

### How to run

Save as `resistor_iv.cir` and run:

```bash
ngspice resistor_iv.cir
```

At the ngspice prompt you can also type:

```
plot v(in) -i(V1)
```

Note: `i(V1)` reports the current through the voltage source using SPICE's sign convention. In this file the current flowing **out of** the positive terminal appears negative, so `-i(V1)` plots the positive-valued current through the resistor (makes the I–V line slope positive).

### Expected numeric results (Ohm's law)

With $R = 1\text{k}\Omega$:

* For 0 V → 0 mA
* For 1 V → 1 mA
* For 5 V → 5 mA
* For 10 V → 10 mA

### Small sample table (for 0.5 V steps)

| V (V) |    I (A) | I (mA) |
| ----: | -------: | -----: |
|   0.0 | 0.000000 |    0.0 |
|   0.5 | 0.000500 |    0.5 |
|   1.0 | 0.001000 |    1.0 |
|   2.0 | 0.002000 |    2.0 |
|   5.0 | 0.005000 |    5.0 |
|  10.0 | 0.010000 |   10.0 |

### Exporting data

```spice
set filetype=ascii
wrdata resistor_iv_data.txt v(in) i(V1)
```

If you want positive currents, post-process the file (multiply by -1) or use `-i(V1)` directly in `.print` or `wrdata` if supported.

## 2. DC Sweep Analysis

A **DC sweep** varies a voltage or current source over a range of values and records how the circuit responds.
This is often used to generate I–V characteristics of diodes or transistors.

### Example: Diode I–V Curve

Create a file named `diode_iv.cir` with the following content:

```spice
* Diode IV characteristic using DC sweep
V1 anode 0 0
D1 anode cathode Dmodel
R1 cathode 0 1k

.model Dmodel D
.dc V1 0 1 0.01

.print dc v(anode) i(V1)
.end
```

Explanation:

* `V1 anode 0 0` defines a voltage source to be swept.
* `D1` is a diode with model `Dmodel`.
* `R1` is a load resistor.
* `.model Dmodel D` defines a default diode model.
* `.dc V1 0 1 0.01` sweeps V1 from 0 V to 1 V in 0.01 V steps.
* `.print dc v(anode) i(V1)` prints the voltage at node `anode` and the current through `V1`.

### Running the Simulation

Run:

```bash
ngspice diode_iv.cir
```

At the prompt, you can also type:

```
plot v(anode) i(V1)
```

to see the I–V curve of the diode.

## Applications

* **Operating point analysis**

  * Biasing point of BJTs and MOSFETs in amplifiers.
  * Verifying DC node voltages in biasing networks.
  * Establishing initial conditions before AC or transient simulations.

* **DC sweep analysis**

  * Obtaining diode, BJT, and MOSFET I–V characteristics.
  * Measuring transfer functions (Vout vs Vin).
  * Exploring the effect of varying supply voltages.

## Tips & Tricks

* Use `.print` to print specific voltages and currents:

  ```spice
  .print dc v(out) i(R1)
  ```
* Both `.op` and `.dc` can be used in the same file.
* To save simulation data for plotting in external tools:

  ```spice
  set filetype=ascii
  wrdata results.txt v(out) i(V1)
  ```
* Ngspice plots can be exported to `.png` files for including screenshots in your documentation:

  ```spice
  hardcopy plot.png
  ```
