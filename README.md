## ðŸ“– About this Repo

This repository is the central place where we will keep all the **Ngspice circuit programs, tutorials, and notes** used in the course.  
Think of it as your **digital lab notebook** â€“ you can find ready-to-run SPICE netlists, example waveforms, and short explanations for each concept we cover in lectures and labs.  

If you are new to Ngspice, donâ€™t worry. Everything here is meant to be beginner-friendly:  
- Copy the netlist files â†’ run in Ngspice â†’ observe waveforms.  
- Follow the tutorials â†’ understand step by step how the analysis works.  
- Use this as a reference when doing lab assignments or practicing on your own.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

Hereâ€™s how the repo is organized:

```
ngspice-circuits/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ tutorials/      # Step-by-step Markdown guides for each analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/       # Ready-to-run .cir files (grouped by topic: diode, bjt, opampâ€¦)
â”œâ”€â”€ figures/        # Plots and screenshots (to match with tutorials)
â””â”€â”€ docs/           # Extra notes, references, cheat-sheets
```

- **`tutorials/`** â†’ Explains each topic (DC, AC, transient, etc.) with examples.  
- **`examples/`** â†’ All the actual Ngspice netlist files you can run directly.  
- **`figures/`** â†’ Supporting images (waveforms, plots, diagrams).  
- **`docs/`** â†’ Extra reference material.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Install Ngspice (Linux: `sudo apt install ngspice`, Windows: use installer).  
2. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ngspice-circuits.git
   cd ngspice-circuits
   ```
3. Browse `tutorials/` â†’ read the concept.  
4. Open the corresponding `.cir` file from `examples/` â†’ run it in Ngspice:  
   ```bash
   ngspice examples/diode/diode_iv_sweep.cir
   ```
